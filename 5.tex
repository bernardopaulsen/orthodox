\chapter{Reason}

    The whole of our phisolophy amounts to ``follow reason''. ``Reason'' (Definition \ref{def:reason}), nevertheless, is a higher-level concept, and to grasp its meaning one must first grasp its hierarchical roots. These are what we have been discussing about in the chapters above.

        \begin{definition}[Reason]
        \label{def:reason}
            Method of cognition that proceeds in accordance with facts, which are established, directly or indirectly, by observation.
            
            The faculty that:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item identifies and integrates the material provided by man's senses;
                \item enables man to discover the nature of existents â€” by virtue of its power to condense sensory information in accordance with the requirements of an objective mode of cognition;
                \item organizes perceptual units in conceptual terms by following the principles of logic.
            \end{itemize}
        \end{definition}

        \begin{remark}
            The latter formulation highlights the three elements essential to the faculty: its data, percepts; its form, concepts; its method, logic.
        \end{remark}
