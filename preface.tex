    This book is based on ``Objectivism: the Philosophy of Ayn Rand'' by Leonard Peikoff. Leonard's book develops the philosophy of objectivism in an impressively structured way. Nevertheless, I believe it would be interesting to see it written in a more straightforward and rigorous manner. That is what I try to accomplish in this book.

    Now, a disclaimer: I'm new (extremely new) to philosophy, and I have never studied philosophy formally, only by reading books by my own. I have written this book beacuse objectivism - especially as a full philosophic system - helped me understand the interconnections and interdependence between ideas as no other philosophy ever did. I do not expect the ideas on this book to be perfectly developed. Also I do not expect to forever hold the opinions that derive from them. However, I do expect to continue to believe in what I consider the main ideas presented in this book - reason and liberty.
