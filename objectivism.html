 id="x1-3000"></a>Preface</h2>
<a 
 id="Q1-1-5"></a>
<!--l. 4--><p class="noindent" >This book is based on &#8220;Objectivism: the Philosophy of Ayn Rand&#8221; by Leonard
Peikoff. Leonard&#8217;s book develops the philosophy of objectivism in an impressively
structured way. Nevertheless, I believe it would be interesting to see it written in a
more straightforward and rigorous manner. That is what I try to accomplish in this
book.
<!--l. 6--><p class="indent" >   Now, a disclaimer: I&#8217;m new (extremely new) to philosophy, and I have never
studied philosophy formally, only by reading books by my own. I have written this
book beacuse objectivism - especially as a full philosophic system - helped me
understand the interconnections and interdependence between ideas as no other
philosophy ever did. I do not expect the ideas on this book to be perfectly developed.
Also I do not expect to forever hold the opinions that derive from them. However, I
do expect to continue to believe in what I consider the main ideas presented in this
book - reason and liberty.

keep its units differentiated from all other existents.

concepts are detached from reality then so are the propositions that employ them. A
proposition can have no greater validity than do the concepts that make it up. The
precondition of the quest for truth, therefore, is the formulation of proper
definitions.
<!--l. 182--><p class="indent" >   A concept is not interchangeable with its definition. A concept designates
existents, including all their characteristics, whether definitional or not.
<!--l. 184--><p class="indent" >   It is crucially important to grasp the fact that a concept is an &#8220;open-end&#8221;
classification which includes the yet-to-be-discovered characteristics of a given group
of existents. One important implication of the above is that a concept, once formed,
does not change. The knowledge men have of the units may grow and the definition
may change accordingly, but the concept, the mental integration, remains the
same.

<!--l. 3--><p class="noindent" >We will now begin to identify the rules men must follow in their thinking if
knowledge is the goal. These rules can be condensed into one principle: thinking, to
be valid, must adhere to reality. But how does one guarantee adherence to reality?
The answer lies in the concept of &#8221;objectivity&#8221;.

<!--l. 7--><p class="noindent" >&#8221;Objectivity&#8221; arises because concepts are formed by a specific process and, as a
result, bear a specific kind of relationship to reality. Concepts do not pertrain to
consciousness alone or to existence alone, they are products of a specific
kind of relationship between the two. Abstractions are products of man&#8217;s
faculty of cognition, which, concerned with grasping reality, must adhere to
it.
<!--l. 9--><p class="indent" >   Conceptualization is not an automatic reaction to stimuli (as perception is).
Concept formation is volitional, requiring effort. Man must learn to do it correctly. In
such processing, the basic method he uses, measurement-omission, is dictated by the
nature of his cognitive faculty. The result is a human perspective on things, not a
revelation of a special sort of entity or attribute intrinsic in the world apart from
man.
<!--l. 11--><p class="indent" >   On the other hand, consciousness is the faculty of grasping that which is, and
there is a metaphysical basis for concepts. The charateristics of entities is a fact, not
a creation of man. The method of concept formation conforms each step to facts,
otherwise it would be irrelevant to a cognitive need.

<!--l. 63--><p class="indent" >   Man (and only man) needs morality in order to survive. Moral laws are principles
that define how to nourish and sustain human life. It is the science of human
self-preservation. Man needs a moral code because his life requires a specific course of
action and, being a conceptual entity, he cannot follow this course except by the
guidance of concepts.
<!--l. 65--><p class="indent" >   No action an organism takes is irrelevant to its existence, therefore, morality
applies to every action. For a rational being, principled action is the only effective
kind of action.
<!--l. 67--><p class="indent" >   A code of values based on reason and proper to man must hold life as the
ultimate value. All that which is proper to the life of a rational being is the good; all
that which destroys it is the evil.

<!--l. 71--><p class="noindent" >What are the principles of human survival? What objects must man hold as values if
he is to preserve his life, and what virtues must he practice in order to achieve
them?
<!--l. 73--><p class="indent" >   The faculty of reason is man&#8217;s basic tool of survival. The primary choice is to
exercise this faculty or not. If life is the standard, therefore, the basic moral principle
is obvious. It tells us the proper evaluation of reason.
<!--l. 75--><p class="indent" >   To live, man must hold three things as the supreme and ruling values of his life:
Reason&#8212;Purpose&#8212;Self-esteem. Reason, as his only tool of knowledge&#8212;Purpose, as
his choice of the happiness which that tool must proceed to achieve&#8212;Self-esteem, as
his inviolate certainty that his mind is competent to think and his person is worthy of
happiness, which means: is worthy of living. These three values imply and require all
of man&#8217;s virtues...
<!--l. 77--><p class="indent" >   Epistemology tells us reason is valid. Ethics tells us reason is a value - is
important. If one choses to live, one must hold reason as a value.

   </div>
<!--l. 84--><p class="indent" >   &#8221;Rationality,&#8221; according to Ayn Rand, is &#8221;the recognition and acceptance of
reason as one&#8217;s only source of knowledge, one&#8217;s only judge of values and one&#8217;s only
guide to action.&#8221;
<!--l. 86--><p class="indent" >   This means the application of reason to every aspect of one&#8217;s life and
concerns. It means choosing and validating one&#8217;s opinions, one&#8217;s decisions, one&#8217;s
work, one&#8217;s love, in accor- dance with the normal requirements of a cognitive
process, the requirements of logic, objectivity, integration. Put nega- tively,
the virtue means never placing any consideration above one&#8217;s perception of
reality.
<!--l. 88--><p class="indent" >   By the same token, there is only one primary vice, which is the root of all other
human evils: irrationality. This is the deliberate suspension of consciousness, the
refusal to see, to think, to know.
<!--l. 90--><p class="indent" >   Now let me con- sider certain aspects of rationality in greater detail.
<!--l. 92--><p class="indent" >   To begin with, one cannot follow reason unless one ex- ercises it. Rationality
demands continual mental activity. Rationality requires the systematic use of one&#8217;s
intelligence.
<!--l. 94--><p class="indent" >   The point is not that one must become a genius or even an intellectual. Contrary
to a widespread fallacy, reason is a faculty of human beings, not of &#8221;supermen.&#8221; The
moral point here is always to grow mentally, to increase one&#8217;s knowledge and expand
the power of one&#8217;s consciousness to the extent one can, whatever one&#8217;s profession or
the degree of one&#8217;s intelligence.
<!--l. 96--><p class="indent" >   The men of virtue are the men who choose to practice and welcome this kind of
struggle on principle, as a lifelong commitment.
<!--l. 98--><p class="indent" >   Just as every idea has a relationship to one&#8217;s other ideas, and none can be
accepted until it is seen to be an element of a single cognitive whole; so every fact has
a relationship to other facts, and none can be evaded without tearing apart and
destroying that kind of whole.
<!--l. 100--><p class="indent" >   The existential side of rationality is the policy of acting in accordance with one&#8217;s
rational conclusions. There is no point in using one&#8217;s mind if the knowledge one gains
thereby is not one&#8217;s guide in action.
<!--l. 102--><p class="indent" >   This aspect of rationality subsumes several obligations.29 It requires that one
choose not only his abstract values but also his specific goals by a process of rational
thought. It requires that one know what his motives are. It requires that one choose
the means to his ends by reference to explicitly defined principles, both moral and
scientific. And it requires that one then enact the means, accepting the law of
causality in full.
<!--l. 104--><p class="indent" >   In epistemology, we concluded that emotions are not tools of cognition. The
corollary in ethics is that they are not guides to action.
<!--l. 106--><p class="indent" >   The proper approach in this issue is not reason versus emotion, but reason first
and then emotion. This approach, as we have seen, leads to the harmony of reason
and emotion, which is the normal state of a rational man.
